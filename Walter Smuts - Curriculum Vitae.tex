{I've attained special interest in courses that applies the mathematics of complex
analysis, including Digital Signal Processing and Control engineering. I
frequently attended lectures not in my syllabus purely for the love of learning.
These include all the lectures in the "Theory of Computation" course and many
lectures given by the UCT Mathematics Society.}
