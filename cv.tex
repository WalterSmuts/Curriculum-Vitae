in the music programme, playing trumpet for more than 4 school bands.}

\section{Final Year Project}

\cvitem{Title}{\emph{Pitch Correction} of Digital Audio}
\cvitem{Supervisors}{Associate Professor Fred Nicolls}
\cvitem{Description}{The goal of this project was to design a system capable of
correcting the pitch of a monophonic instrument. It involved designing a prototype
on Matlab and testing different configurations using rigorous metrics to asses the
success of the prototype.}
