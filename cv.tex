\section{Education}

\subsection{University of Cape Town}
\img{UCT.jpg}
I’m studying Electrical and Computer engineering (BSc Eng)
currently in my 4th year. I’m on the standard 4 year
program and have not failed a single subject, achieving a
GPA of 65\%.

My favorite courses thus far has been signals and systems,
control theory and computer science. I thoroughly enjoyed
the mathematical foundations and essence of theses subjects.

I am part of the Mathematical society (MamSoc) and was
involved in the Algorithm circle (Computer Science Club)
during my first year. Throughout my studies I often play
squash, hike and go swimming.

\subsection{Pretoria Boys High School}
\img{PBHS.jpg}
My elective choices for my high school career was Music,
information Technology, Physical Sciences and Advanced
Programme Mathematics. I achieved 3 distinctions for my
NSC certificate with an average of 78\% and 67\% for
Advanced programme mathematics (an IEB subject).

Most of my involvement in high school was related to the
music department. I played first trumpet for the orchestra,
wind band, Dixie band and brass choir. I thoroughly enjoyed
public performances and the constant exposure to music.

I played squash throughout my high school career and
cricket during the first two years. I was one of the lucky few
who got accepted for bush school, spending a term in the
Magaliesberg north of Pretoria. The experience gave me an
intense love of nature. I was part of the hiking club during
my 4th and 5th years and went on numerous hikes with and
without the hiking club.

\section{Projects}

\subsection{TuneMe - University Project}

For our third year embedded systems course we were
tasked with doing a music-based embedded project in
groups of 4. I was the group leader and presented the idea
for making a real-time autotuning DSP project for karaoke.

We managed to get real time pitch shifting working but ran
out of time and could not create a fully auto tuning system.
The overall project was a success and we achieved 73\%.

\subsection{Mandelbrot Zoom - Personal Project}

A java program (with some bash scripts) that draws the
Mandelbrot set at incremental crop levels, producing a set
of images. These images are stitched together to produce a
zooming video.

\subsection{LMMS - Open Source Project}

LMMS is an open source digital audio workspace developed
on GitHub by many open source Linux developers. The goal
is to be a Linux alternative for software like fl-studios.

I submitted three issues and two pull requests to solve two
of these issues. Both pull requests were accepted into the
main branch and the other issue was quickly resolved by
another developer. I still plan on contributing more to the
project in the future.

\subsection{Digital Speedometer - Personal Project}

My motorbike, a KLR-650, does not have a fuel gauge or fuel
consumption meter. I decided to add this functionality by
making an Arduino based interface, LCD Screen and
buttons, with a speedometer (Hall effect based) and fuel
flow meter (part from china). These parts should be capable
of calculating speed, fuel consumption, fuel left and even
estimated distance on tank.

The interface and speedometer sections were successful
but unfortunately the flow meter seemed to be faulty.

\section{Experience}

\subsection{Project Management - Project Manager}

During my third year of studies I took a course on project
management. I ended up being the project manager in a
group of 7 people.

Structuring a project from scratch and organizing the project
into tasks were the main skills I learnt by being the project
manager. Creating an environment where it was easy for
everyone to complete their task was my main focus.

\subsection{The Turntable Guy - Intern Technician}

Because of my interest in audio I took an intern job at an
audiophile shop. The shop focuses on fixing old amplifiers
and turntables.

The majority of my time was spent servicing, debugging and
fixing old audio amplifiers. Some time was spent fixing
turntables and helping customers.

\subsection{Expertron - Engineering Intern}

Expertron is a Linux-based software engineering and IT
consulting company. I took the position to see what the
process of Linux-based development involved.

I was tasked to implement a content management system
(CMS) based on SilverStripe for their website. This gave me
lots of exposure to CSS and practical use in deploying a
Linux based system.

\subsection{For the love of Yummyness - Crêpe Chef}

A university friend asked if I could help out at a crêpe stand
at the Old Biscuit Mill. I eventually got hired permanently.
When studies started to required my attention I only worked
when needed.

I learnt how to work with clients and the dynamics of a
workplace. It gave me exposure of the tourist parts of Cape
Town and was a great introduction to the city.
